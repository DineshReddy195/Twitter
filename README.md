## Bookmarks

In bookmarks we need data to be fetched from backend, hence I have done a static page showing that data is not present in bookmarks page.

## Signup
For signup I have given feature like whenever user typed their data in input tags and submitted all that data will be stored in LocalStorage.

## Signin

In signin user will enter the data what that person has given for signup, it will validate with the details in local storage, if the entered details are ture. It will allow user to login, else it will show alert to check the details.
